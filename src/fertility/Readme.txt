In progress - turn this into real documentation.

Add ability to have more than "simple" fertility.  Simple is defined as
yes/no and starts/stops.

Add loading various fertility scenarios/parameters from database so they
can be defined outside the code.  Routines to load, modify, and save will
be needed.

For now, setting up defaults as hardcoded.
