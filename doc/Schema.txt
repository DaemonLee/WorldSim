Schema Notes
============


Master Database
---------------

    Table: RegionList
        region_id	numeric id, unique across all regions (1)
        name		string name
        dbfile		filename (2)
        status		active, inactive (dead/destroyed/archived?)
        start		timedate the region starts (3)
        end		timedate the region ends (3)

    (1) The id is used as an additional identifier for objects in the region.
        For example, each region assigns a person a numeric id.  These ids
        are not unique across all regions, only within the region.  When a
        person transfers to another region or when people from multiple
        regions are processed together, the region id plus the person id
        is guaranteed to be unique across all regions for any person.

    (2) The dbfile string is created from the name by:
        - convert all letters to lower case
        - convert spaces to underscores
        - add the extension ".db"

    (3) The start and end timedates are used to indicate processing is not
        needed.  For example, if a region ends (perhaps it was utterly
        destroyed) on 10000 then that region doesn't need to be included
        in typical processing after that timedate.


Regional Database
-----------------

    Table: Person
        person_id	numeric id, unique within this region (1)
        gender		male, female (2)
        birth		timedate of birth
        death		timedate of death
        mother_id	person id of genetic mother (3)
        father_id	person id of genetic father (3)
        num_offspring	number of offspring, if any (4)

    (1) A person_id is created for each person born or first appearing
        within this region.

    (2) Currently, only allowing for human genders.

    (3) Will need a code to indicate that the mother/father data is
        located in a different regional database.  (Possibly use a negative
        number - the negative indicates to look it up, and the number
        indicates which transaction id in the lookup table.)  Also,
        need an unknown id code.

    (4) Need a none code and an unknown code.  Possibly a "at least this
        many" code.  Or should this field just be number of known offspring?
