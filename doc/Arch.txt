Architecture Notes
==================

This document is an informally written set of notes on the architecture of
WorldSim.  Very much a work in progress.


Calendar
--------

    Currently, only 1 calendar is supported.  This calendar is based on
    earth's (current) tropical calendar, but simplified.  This tropical
    year, unlike earth's, does not vary.

        1 minute = 60 seconds
        1 hour = 60 minutes
        1 day = 24 hours
        1 tropical year = 365.2422 days

    The calendar year starts on the same day as the northern vernal equinox
    and lasts through the day preceeding the next northern vernal equinox.
    This means that most calendar years are 365 days with an extra day
    every few years.

    The lunar cycle and months have not been determined yet.


Libraries
---------

rng
    This random number generator library contains various convenience
    routines to generate pseudo-random numbers.

calendar
    This library contains the routines that handle the calendar and all
    calendar math.  See the Calendar Section in this document for more
    information on the calendar itself.
